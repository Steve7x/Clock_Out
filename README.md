***For best results please combine with a Scheduled Task***

Once started the app will begin a countdown to the time when the worker can clock out, hence why its 
best to fuse with a Scheduled Task for more accurate results. A very small console window with the 
time visable will open in the top left corner of the screen as to not be in the way of the users
other activities. It's default start time is an average 8 hour work day.
